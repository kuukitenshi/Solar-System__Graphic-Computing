# Solar System - WebGl

This project was a collaborative effort involving two more colleagues for our ```Graphic Computing``` subject.

The project's objectives was to create a realistic ```Solar System``` using ```WebGl```, with this we achived a ```perfect score```.

## Interface

The interface allows you to:
- Swap the shader type between Shader Phong and Gouraud
- Remove or set the components of difuse and ambient light
- Change the amount of specular light
- Stop the translational movement of the planets and asteroids


---
## Model

The implementation of this model of a Solar System contains:
- The Sun
- The 8 main planets of the Solar System, since Mercury to Neptune
- The dwarf planet Pluto
- Earth's moon, 3 moons of Jupyter and 2 of Saturn
- Asteroid belt with 100 asteroids
- Kuiper belt with 200 asteroids
- A skybox with for the background


Furthermore, the scale and rotation period of the plantes are according to the real values.

## Camera
You can use the following commands to control the camera:
- ```WASD``` or ```arrows```: to move forward, left, backward and rigth, respectively
- ```Space```: to move the camera up
- ```Ctrl```: to move the camera down
- ```Left shift```: while pressed increases the speed of the camera by a factor
- ```1```: places the camera following the Earth, until the key is pressed again or the camera is moved
- ```2```: places the camera on the surface of the Sun
- ```Mouse```: alows you to rotate the camera horizontally and vertically in first person
